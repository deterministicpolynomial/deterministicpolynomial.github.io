Hi! My name is Samuel Nijsten. I graduated with an MSc in Computer Science from Eindhoven University of Technology, and this blog is my little corner of the internet.

I started this site to jot down some of the nice proofs, elegant theorems, or interesting results I stumble upon in my free time — whether while studying, reading papers, or just exploring math and computer science on my own.

Some of these ideas are classic, some are quirky, and others are just beautiful in how they tie things together. Writing about them helps me understand them better, and maybe they'll be helpful (or at least interesting) to others too.

If you're into proofs, puzzles, or just want to appreciate the elegance of theoretical computer science and mathematics — welcome!
